|FATS Inc. are proud to present their first product - Rewardr. This is a corporate reward system which forms part of our Final Project at Makers Academy. Rewardr allows Managers to issue their staff with a Reward in the form of a badge via a Web App built with Ruby on Rails. It was designed to be simple to use for both Managers and Employees. It is not a social media site for the office. Employees log in and see their Dashboard which lists personal stats and a few company stats too. Managers have an additional page where they can select from a list of Rewards or even name their own.

Badgr is an cross-platform App built using PhoneGap - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Parse was used for the database. The design was based around the Yo App, however when clicking on a friend's name a box appears showing a selection of badge icons for you to send to your friend.

TIMstagram allows users to sign up and upload pictures for all users to view on a main feed. Users are also able to click on photos individually to give 'Likes' and leave comments. PostgreSQL was used as the database. HTML and CSS were using to coordinate the front end. Check out the Link live on heroku [here](http://pacific-castle-9436.herokuapp.com/)|
